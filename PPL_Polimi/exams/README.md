# Exams solutions
In this folder you can find solutions to some exams of past years of the *Principles of Programming Language* course held at Politecnico di Milano.

Since the course is centered around Scheme, Haskell and Erlang, here you won't find only Haskell code. Still I didn't want to create a new repo just for solving course exams so consider this *an indelible stain of impurity*, a must to reach some higher goal.
