# Haskell Playground of Leonardo Arcari

This repository is a personal place to play around with Haskell during my studying activities. So feel free to look somewhere else, because only incomplete, probabily broken pieces of Haskell code can be found here.

Sorry for stealing you those valuable seconds that took you to go through this useless README.
